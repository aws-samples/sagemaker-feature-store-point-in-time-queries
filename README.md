This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks plus some schema files used to create our Feature Groups. The purpose of the notebooks is described as:

•	1_generate_creditcard_transactions.ipynb : generates raw transaction data for credit cards and consumers </br>
•	2_create_feature_groups.ipynb : creates two feature groups used to store aggregate features for consumer data and credit card data </br>
•	3_fs_get_historical_features.ipynb: creates the periodic snapshots of aggregate data, writes them to the Feature Store, creates the entity dataframe, and creates and executes the point-in-time queries </br>

Instance Types:
Please note our recommendation about instance types. To run the various Spark Dataframe operations (like foreachPartion, and redu
ceByKey), notebook #3 configures non-default parameters for the Spark session object. To run this notebook properly, we recommend
 using an instance type that allocates at least 32 GB RAM. We have successfully tested these notebooks on the following instance
types: ml.c5.4xlarge, ml.m5.4xlarge.
